# ⭐ cvnella kernel

**What’s poppin’ fam?**

- **Just a Lil’ Reminder**: That cute Genshin Impact character "Paimon"? Not mine, just some dope fan art I found on Google. Major respect to the artist! 🎨✨

- **What’s the 411?**: I’m out here trying to whip up this ultra-custom eureka kernel fork! This is an open-source vibe check, still in the oven, so keep your eyes peeled for some lit updates! 🔥🚀

- **Keep It Real**: If you snag any of my goodies, just make sure to keep it open source and slide me some credit! Sharing is caring, y’all! 🤗💯

- **Stay in the Loop**: Hit that star button and follow along for the glow-up! Your support means the world! 🌍💖

Thanks for dropping by💖✨
